### Hello!

I am a fairly average person who happens to enjoy making video games. Recently I have been using Godot, but have previously used Gamemaker and Construct 2. All these games were done in Godot, and all the art was done in Piskel.

[Archea][Archea] is the one I have spent the most time on, and I think it is the best game I've made to date. It was inspired by Dead Cells, which is a platformer where you run through levels and fight bad guys and collect treasure (like most games).

[Frost][Frost] is the second-best one in my opinion. I made it over five long days, technechally for a game jam, but the game jam was for Unreal Engine, which I don't know. So, I used Godot and didn't submit this game. The theme for the game jam was something like "What is hidden in snow comes forth in the thaw", so I did the obvious thing and made a deckbuilding game whith fire and ice monsters fighting each other. My younger brother helped me with a lot of the art.

And then there's [Kite Man][Kite Man]. Made for Ludem Dare 46, themed Keep it Alive, over the course of one day. The game jam was a two-day thing, but my first idea didn't work out, so I was left with the second day to make something.
